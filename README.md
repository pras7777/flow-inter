# flow-inter
To successfully complete the project:

1. **FungibleToken Standard on Flow Usage**:
   - Ensure that your smart contract adheres to the FungibleToken standard on the Flow blockchain.
   - Implement functions such as `transfer`, `balance`, etc., as per the standard.

2. **Admin Withdrawal Functionality**:
   - Develop a function that allows the admin to withdraw tokens from a user's Vault at any time.
   - Upon withdrawal, the equivalent amount of $FLOW tokens should be deposited into the admin's account.

3. **Vault Balance Retrieval**:
   - Implement a function that returns the balance of both the user's $FLOW vault and your custom vault.
   - Users should be able to check their vault balances through this function.

4. **Depositing $FLOW for Custom Token**:
   - Create a mechanism that enables users to deposit $FLOW tokens and receive your custom token in return.
   - Implement necessary checks to ensure accurate token exchange.

5. **Transaction Architecture**:
   - Ensure that all transactions within the smart contract are correctly architected.
   - Implement proper error handling and validation mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access or errors.

6. **Readme File**:
   - Create a comprehensive README file that provides clear instructions on how to:
     - Deploy the smart contract.
     - Interact with the smart contract (e.g., depositing $FLOW, withdrawing tokens, checking balances).
     - Any additional details or considerations for users or developers.
     - Include information on the structure of your smart contract, key functions, and any dependencies.
